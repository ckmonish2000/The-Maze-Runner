# The-Maze-Runner
This Project Demonstrates The Use Of Search Algorithms Like Dfs and Bfs.......


## How It Works And What Are The DataStructures Used

This Project Uses The [Bfs] and [Dfs] Algorithm to find the Shortest Path Between Two points.
It's Also a Refresher TO understand Concepts Like [Stacks],[Queues] and [Trees]....

## How To Use It

##Algorithms

```
The algorithms have a prebuilt tree in a folder called path.py
to use Dfs or Bfs algorithms use the specific main.py files in the Algo's folder
````

##Path Finder
To Play with The Maze Runner Change The Source [O] And Destination [X] In The main.py File 
And Run The Following Command In The Command Line Tool.

```
python main.py
````
